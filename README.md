# [Starveling]
Starveling is a CSS boilerplate derived from the fantastic skeleton.css

Check out <http://starve.me> for documentation and details.

## Getting started

- [Download the zip](https://github.com/any-code/starveling/archive/0.0.1.zip)
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/any-code/starveling.git` (Note: this is under active development)


### What's in the download?

The download includes Starveling's CSS, Normalize CSS as a reset, a sample favicon, and an index.html as a starting point.

```
starveling/
├── index.html
├── css/
│   ├── normalize.css
│   └── starveling.css
└── images/
    └── favicon.ico

```

### Why it's awesome

Starveling is lightweight and simple. It styles only raw HTML elements (with a few exceptions) and provides a responsive grid. Nothing more.
- Around 550 lines of CSS unminified and with comments
- It's a starting point, not a UI framework
- No compiling or installing...just vanilla CSS


## Browser support

- Chrome latest
- Firefox latest
- Opera latest
- Safari latest
- IE 9+

The above list is non-exhaustive. Starveling works perfectly with almost all older versions of the browsers above, though IE certainly has large degradation prior to IE9.
